# Who are we? 

- [Antonia G. Viyachka:]{style="color: orange"} Procurement Specialist at the World Bank leading and supervising this project.

- [Lu√≠za Andrade:]{style="color: orange"} Data Scientist at the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation department, specializing in promoting research transparency and reproducibility practices through trainings and code review.

- [Sushmita Samaddar:]{style="color: orange"} Research Analyst at the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation department, specializing in public procurement, organizational management and governance research 

# Learning Objectives

Tell us more about yourself. What are your learning goals in this training program and how do you use data analysis in your current work?

# Learning Objectives

- Participants will thoroughly familiarize themselves with the [Stata interface]{style="color: orange"}.

- Participants will be [learn and practice]{style="color: orange"} the foundational functions in Stata for data analysis.

- Participants will learn how to [find the answers and troubleshoot]{style="color: orange"} on data analysis and coding questions

- Participants will learn about the [best practices]{style="color: orange"} in conducting data analysis and reproducible research.

# What happens after the training?

- The training will provide the [basics]{style="color: orange"} on how to code on Stata and how to do data analysis using public procurement data. 

- The way to solidify knowledge on data analysis in Stata is to [practice, practice, practice!]{style="color: orange"}

- No data scientist has all the answers, but all data scientists know how to [ask for help]{style="color: orange"}.

# How will the sessions be organized?

The sessions will mostly be hands-on labs where you can work on Stata while learning the basic functions. 

- Introduction to the Stata interface, statistical programming 101
- How to create a data map, data management and folder structure
- Exploring and tidying data in Stata
- Importing, cleaning and constructing data in Stata
- Data visualization and analysis in Stata
- Introduction to data visualization in Tableau
- Best practices for coding in Stata

# How will the sessions be organized?

- The training will use public procurement data extracted from the eProcurement system in Croatia. 
- [However]{style="color: orange"} please note that the only a [small sample]{style="color: orange"} of the data will be used for practice sessions. 
- This is because the full dataset is too heavy for light practice sessions. You should however, use what you learn in this training to apply to the full dataset after the training.
- The goal of this training is to learn how to use Stata for data analysis. 
- The analysis you do in this training will have results that you may not expect - this is because we are looking at only a small sample of the data. 

[*Don't focus on the results -- let's focus on the way to get there.*]{style="color: orange; text-align: center;"}

# Where do we start before we start?

- Work closely with your partners and [set the right expectations]{style="color: orange; text-align: center;"} on what can be achieved given data availability.
- These are long and very time-consuming steps even if not complicated from a technical standpoint.
- Establish a [solid communication line]{style="color: orange; text-align: center;"} with your team and project leaders for the next steps of the work.

# Collection of relevant data

- You can go beyond traditional sources of procurement data to answer novel and relevant questions on public procurement
  - For example, is there an effect of motivation, resources and incentives on procurement outcomes like processing time?
  - Does payment regularity have an effect on firm participation and competition in future contracts?
- Procurement is more than just transactions between the government and firms. It is driven by people and motivations

# Making sense of your data - is it complete?

- Ensure that all the important [data fields]{style="color: orange"} identified in the pre-analysis plan are available in the collected data.
- Check that most of the [observations are non-missing]{style="color: orange"} for the pre-identified data fields and, in case of missing values, understand why.
- Ensure that you can identify the [level of observation]{style="color: orange"} of your datasets. For example, you know which dataset is at procurement process level, contract level or bid level.

# Making sense of your data - can it be linked?

- Identify a [unique identifier]{style="color: orange"} from each dataset. This can be the Contract ID, Tender ID, Bid ID, Product ID etc.
- Check that all datasets have at least one or more matching unique identifiers and match. 
- We will learn more about unique identifiers in the later sessions.

# Making sense of your data - does it make sense?

- Check whether the data you are using is [correct]{style="color: orange"} by making sure some key values and dates make sense. 
  - For example, you can do this by checking if the contract value is impossibly high (e.g. more than 2 standard deviations from mean) or;
  - if the date entries are impossible (e.g. a tender opening date earlier than tender advertisement date).
- Check whether the [data structure]{style="color: orange"} follows what is expected from the national legal framework.
